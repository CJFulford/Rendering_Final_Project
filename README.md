# Rendering_Final_Project

Rendering project for CPSC 591 at the University of Calgary, Fall 2016

Demonstration of Fire and Smoke against a night background

Current Status:

Trying to get a light to appear inside each of the logs that is affected by the texture that is rotating about the logs and provides light to the floor, possibly skybox.
logs and fire will have basic lighting equations due to the fact that they are what produces light.

Overall Status:

Skybox mesh added and textured
Floor mesh added and textured
Logs mesh added and textured
Fire not added
Smoke not added
Lighting incomplete
